# General Layout

Let's think about the general layout here.

From top-to-bottom, we have a `header`, `content` and `footer` containers.

Let's try our best using semantic markup, such as `<header>` `<section>` `<footer>`

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Clean and Gleam</title>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="keywords" content="">
        <meta name="description" content="My description">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        </head>
    <body>
        <main>
            <header></header>
            <section></section>
            <footer></footer>
        </main>
    </body>
</html>

```

> From here on, I won't show the whole file, just from the body (takes a lotta space yk how it goes). <br>Here's how that would look like

```html
<main>
    <header></header>
    <section></section>
    <footer></footer>
</main>
```
